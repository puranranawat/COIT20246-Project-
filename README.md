## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design of a reliable, scalable, and secure network infrastructure for Truelec, an Australian electrical contracting organisation with a central headquarters and multiple branch offices. The project addresses the organisation’s networking requirements by proposing a structured wired and wireless network design, supporting operational growth and ensuring high availability.

Project Part 1 concentrates on the technical design of the network for the headquarters and one branch office. The design includes IP addressing, network architecture, redundancy considerations, wireless configuration, and hardware recommendations. The proposed solution is based on realistic assumptions and aligns with industry best practices and course concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organised into multiple Markdown files, each addressing a specific component of the assessment:

- **README.md**  
  Provides an overview of the project, group details, and repository structure.

- **plan.md**  
  Contains the project communication plan and work schedule outlining task allocation and collaboration approach.

- **network.md**  
  Includes the complete network design for Project Part 1, covering assumptions, IP addressing, network architecture, wireless design, hardware selection, diagrams, and design justification.

- **diagrams/**  
  Contains the network diagrams created using diagrams.net (draw.io), including:
  - Headquarters network diagram
  - Branch office network diagram
  - Exported PNG images used in documentation

## Tools and Technologies Used

- diagrams.net (draw.io) for network diagrams  
- GitHub for version control and collaboration  
- Markdown for technical documentation  

---

## Notes

All design decisions are based on the project scenario requirements and clearly stated assumptions. The repository follows professional project practices, including regular commits and structured documentation, to support transparency and effective collaboration.
