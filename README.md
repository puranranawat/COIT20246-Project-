## Project Title
Network Design and Infrastructure Proposal for Truelec

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the design of a reliable, scalable, and secure network infrastructure for Truelec, an Australian electrical contracting organisation with a central headquarters and multiple branch offices. The project addresses the organisation’s networking requirements by proposing a structured wired and wireless network design that supports operational growth and ensures high availability.

Project Part 1 concentrates on the technical design of the network for the headquarters and one branch office. The design includes network architecture, IP addressing, redundancy considerations, wireless configuration, hardware selection, and detailed network diagrams. Project Part 2 extends the work to include cloud service evaluation, cyber security risk assessment, ethical and social issues, and project reflection.

All design decisions are based on realistic assumptions, align with the project scenario, and follow industry best practices and concepts covered in the course.
