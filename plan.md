## Communication Plan

Effective communication is essential to ensure successful collaboration throughout the project. The group uses multiple communication channels to coordinate tasks, discuss progress, and resolve technical or scheduling issues in a timely manner.

The following communication methods are used:
- WhatsApp group for quick updates and day-to-day coordination  
- Zoom meetings for detailed discussions, planning, and design decisions  
- GitHub for technical collaboration, version control, and tracking individual contributions  

Informal communication occurs as required, while structured Zoom meetings are conducted regularly. Additional meetings are scheduled when approaching key milestones to ensure the project remains on track.
