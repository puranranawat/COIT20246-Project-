# Project Plan

## Communication Plan

Effective communication is essential to ensure successful collaboration throughout the project. The group has agreed on the following communication methods and frequency to coordinate tasks, discuss progress, and resolve issues.

### Communication Methods
- WhatsApp group for quick updates and daily coordination  
- Zoom meetings for detailed discussions and design decisions  
- GitHub for technical collaboration, version control, and progress tracking  

### Communication Frequency
- Informal communication via WhatsApp as required  
- Scheduled Zoom meetings twice per week  
- Additional meetings arranged if required before key milestones  

This communication approach ensures timely coordination while allowing flexibility around academic schedules.

## Task Allocation Strategy

All group members contribute to all stages of the project. However, specific responsibilities may vary depending on individual strengths and availability. Technical design, documentation, and review activities are shared to ensure balanced contribution and learning outcomes.

GitHub commits are used as the primary mechanism to track individual contributions. Each group member commits their own work regularly, ensuring transparency and compliance with professional project practices.

## Risk Management and Contingency Planning

To minimise project risks, the group follows these strategies:
- Regular progress checks during scheduled meetings  
- Early identification of technical or scheduling issues  
- Use of GitHub for backup and version control  
- Flexibility in task allocation if workload imbalance occurs  

These measures help ensure the project remains on schedule and meets assessment requirements.

## Summary

This project plan establishes a structured approach to communication, scheduling, and task coordination. By following this plan, the group ensures professional collaboration, consistent progress, and timely completion of all assessment deliverables.
